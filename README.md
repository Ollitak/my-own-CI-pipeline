## Exercises 11.21 and 11.22 of the Full Stack open course

https://fullstackopen.com/en/part11

## Short description

The goal of this exercise was to build a CI/CD pipeline on one of my one projects. I chose a blogs-app project for which a frontend and backend was made earlier this course in parts 4 and 5. The first thing to do was to store both frontend and backend in the same repository in order to simplify the CI/CD configuration process. After that, I created a simple pipeline that lints, tests, builds and deploys the code.
